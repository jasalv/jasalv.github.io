<p><strong>Assignment 7-A URL:</strong> Upload your index.html doc to your server and email me the URL. Add something to the page such as text. Your URL should look like this, https://xxx.github.io/.  Paste your URL into a browser to test before sending. Follow the instructions exactly. If it doesnâ€™t work, I suggest you delete the repository and try again. Due today by 5:00 PM (credit/no credit).</p>

<p><strong><a href="7b.html" style="color:burlywood" target="_blank">Assignment 7-B Sample Page:</a></strong> I posted a word doc in the files folder. Duplicate that doc in html. Use any image you want. Add a background. Upload the new page and the image to GitHub. Add a link on your index page to this new page. Due October 26 (credit/no credit).</p>

<p><strong><a href="7c.html" style="color:burlywood" target="_blank">Assignment 7-C Web Page:</a></strong> Find a topic that interests you. Create a page that would serve as the first page of a site investigating that topic. You will need to decide what general themes that would be included on the first page and organize the information into links.</p>
