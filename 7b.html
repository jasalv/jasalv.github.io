<p>Genomic sequencing offers an unprecedented opportunity to detect inherited variants that are implicated in rare Mendelian disorders, yet there are many challenges to overcome before this technology can routinely be applied in a healthy population.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/abgs/" style="color:burlywood" target="_blank">Age-Based Genomic Screening (ABGS)</a> study is led by a team of researchers at UNC Chapel Hill investigating a novel alternative to genome-scale sequencing at birth. The research project aims to provide highly actionable genetic information to parents over the course of their childâ€™s routine health care.</p>
<p>The ABGS project is funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI grant #R01HG012271) and led by UNC faculty Jonathan S. Berg, MD, PhD (PI, Bryson Distinguished Professor of Genetics and Medicine) and Laura V. Milko, PhD (Co-PI, Assistant Professor of Genetics).</p>
